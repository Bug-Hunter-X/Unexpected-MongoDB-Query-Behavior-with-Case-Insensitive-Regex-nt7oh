```javascript
const query = { name: /John/i }; // Case-insensitive search

db.collection('users').find(query).toArray((err, result) => {
  if (err) throw err; // Handle errors properly
  console.log(result); 
});
```
This code snippet might lead to unexpected results due to the use of the regular expression `/John/i` for a case-insensitive search.  While seemingly simple, if the `name` field contains embedded regex metacharacters (like `.` or `*`), it can cause incorrect matches. For instance, a name like "John.Doe" would match unexpectedly.

Another issue is that errors are simply thrown using `throw err`. A more robust solution would be to log the error with context for better debugging and perhaps provide a fallback mechanism to prevent application crashes.
